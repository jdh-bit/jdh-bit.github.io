The sentence includes a four-year prison sentence (two suspended and two served on house arrest), a €100,000 fine, and a five-year ban on standing for public office. Despite there being a restriction on her physical freedom and a considerable financial penalty, it is the ban that has spilt the most digital ink. The Times of London, The Economist (also of London), and Jacobin magazine (thankfully not of London) all ran pieces declaring the ban anti-democratic; a curious charge to me. Let me explain:\nThe law from which the ban originates is not new, it was voted in 2015 and came into force in 2017. Bans on practicing one’s profession as part of legal punishments are not novel; doctors and lawyers being two famous examples. Recently, French lawyer Thierry Herzog was from practicing for three years in 2023 after losing a corruption trial. In fact, Le Pen is not even the first politician to fall foul of the law. According to data by the French Ministry of Justice via Euronews, 16,364 “ineligibility” sentences were delivered in 2023. One of which was Mr Herzog’s co-defendant, former president Nicolas Sarkozy. Was it anti-democratic when Sarkozy, who is still eligible to run for president, was banned? Where are those who would cry for Sarkozy? Now while just 3.9% of rulings in 2023 came into effect immediately, that is still 639, and the judges justified this rare decision based on the defendants ‘denial of the importance of the offence for which she was convicted.’ In addition, she has the ability to appeal this ruling before the incoming presidential election.\nYou would think that a law was applied, with judicial discretion, that placed Ms Le Pen first among equals, yet the sharp responses produced casts her as uniquely punished and thus damning for the state of democracy. Was it now anti-democratic to punish someone for committing a crime? Investigating further had me asking a question I did not think possible: When, if ever, can someone get away with committing a crime in a democracy?\nAccording to the Economist it is when punishing the crime ‘risks undermining the perceived legitimacy of the next election, because it deprives many voters of their preferred candidate’ [emphasis mine]. Why is this a problem? Because the punishment for the crime does not meet the sufficient grounds for ‘stopping French voters from judging for themselves who should get their vote’. Ah I see, but there is more: there is also the matter of the punishment for the crime encouraging ‘talk of conspiracy—especially if, like Ms Le Pen, the barred politician belongs to a party founded upon a suspicion of the elite.’ What is curious is, despite the use of pseudo-objective phrases that we might all want in a democracy like legitimate elections, their reasoning seems localised to the figure of Le Pen.\nWould the ban still risk undermining electoral legitimacy if many voters did not have her as their preferred candidate or if she, and her party, had not cultivated a fertile ground for anti-elite conspiracies? (Who are the elite and what does it mean to be suspicious of them? The Economist is unfortunately silent). It does not seem like it would, else there would be no need for such a subjective point of view. After all, Ms Le Pen was not the only person from her party made ineligible for public office for a determined time period. However, nothing about them was written. Now on to The Economists’ compatriot newspaper.\nThe Times of London does not begin with context around the law, nor the crime in question, nor do they suggest the decision was legally incorrect. They instead begin with the aborted destiny of the Le Pen Presidency:\n‌ Marine Le Pen has been pushing for the presid­ency of France since 2012, doggedly building her share of the vote for the hard right through three elections. Her best chance of becoming head of state was to win the 2027 presidential election to succeed the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron. Now, a court has seemingly put paid to that dream.\nThe Times frames the decision in such a way that the legal is in the background while foregrounding the political narrative.\nAt a stroke, the judges have displaced one of the most popular politicians in the country, a presidential favourite no less, and dismayed the 12 million who supported her\nMs Le Pen is not a defendant being sentenced but a presidential favourite; rather than a legal decision at the end of a trial, it is ‘at a stroke’; and a dichotomy is created between the judges and the popular politician. This framing informs the justification for the Times putting out an editorial against the decision, because what is at stake here is a worry at how the specific supporters of Le Pen might react:\nThe apparent muzzling of an anti-establishment figure will feed into the culture of grievance that propels the hard right across the world\nSimilar to the Economist, the fear of feeding into conspiracy theories is paramount. Here the apparent (note again the hesitation to declare definitively) muzzling (but more charged language to describe the not real event) will feed into a culture of grievance. Which does not mean it will inflame actual and real grievance only a populous that has been readily primed to accept even perceived and apparent slights as ammunition. The Times does not pass a value judgement on this culture of grievance. Instead, t adds more than the Economist was willing to say: The Times sets up a strange calculus where actions, however legitimate, ought to be avoiding if a group will construe it as an attack on them. And then the kicker:\nAcross the right-wing and nationalist spectrum, from Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro to President Trump, there is rage about unelected judges meddling in politics.\nIt is certainly a choice to list two politicians that previously attempted to overturn the wishes of an electorate, an action that would have dismayed the supporters of their opponents. I add this to underscore something: implied by The Economist and expressed by the Times is a worldview where what is important is the destined takeover of the far-right above and beyond the legal system, judges, or even voters who are not or do not wish to vote and support them. Nothing must be done that could even be construed as an attack on this coming vision, reality be damned.\nLet us leave the United Kingdom and head to Jacobin, a socialist magazine that would pride itself on being against the Times and Economists of the world, and yet.\nIt begins well:\nNo one is above the law, and the court could not rule based on Le Pen’s personal popularity.\nSense at last?\nBut banning candidates from running for office due to financial crimes is highly dubious. The damaging effect on the democratic choice seems out of proportion to the crime in question, and (even coupled with a €2 million fine) is ineffective in punishing the party.\nShame, they started so well! The piece does share part of a statement from left-wing party France Insoumise which argues that this conviction overturns RN’s claim to be ‘uniquely “clean” and stand against corrupt establishment’. However, Jacobin echoes the same talking point from The Economist that all must allow the electorate to judge for themselves the hypocrisy, or lack thereof, of the candidates. I will say that Jacobin is the only publication to rightfully point out that the claim of a conspiracy is undermined by the legal process beginning a decade ago, but once again worries about RN using it as a political rallying cry, where they might frame themselves as defending democracy from elites. How that squares with that already being their modus operandi till now is left unsaid. I bring up Jacobin because, despite its ideological distance from the previous two, it further underlines even with those who might find RN repulsive, the same assumptions remain. Democracy ought to ‘let voters decide’ and anything else, including the legal system, operating under clear and foreseeable rules, should do nothing that could be perceived as limiting their choice. Let’s investigate this.\nWhat is democracy? Or rather what makes a democracy good/functional/legitimate? Is it the existence of elections or those elections mattering? Perhaps it is the ability for parties to lose elections? Whatever your answer, at some point you must escape the focus on elections I laid out. Without the surrounding environment of extra-electoral mechanisms, we have a facsimile or rather a fragile democracy. When you chart the timeline of democracies decaying into authoritarianism, what is disbanded is rarely first elections, but those extra-electoral mechanisms: freedom of speech, press, and associations are targeted, and the independence of the judiciary is threatened. It is that final one that circles us back to Marine Le Pen. By placing the idea of voters and elections above the independence of the judiciary and other extra-electoral mechanisms, not only do the three publications not protect democracy and the integrity of the voter choice, but they also harm it. Nothing I have written is novel, and indeed you will find echoes of this at the very publications I brought up to criticise; The Economist publishes a Democracy Index considering these factors. So, what explains the gap between The Economist of the democracy index and The Economist that roots against upholding the Rule of Law? I have a conjecture.\nDuring the French Revolution, a public document was published. It broke with the monarchical past and declared a new era for what we would now call human rights. It was radical, influential, and contains a dangerous trap. Article 6 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen defines the law as ‘an expression of the general will’. This term is not popular today, but then it was reorienting the law from being the whims of an absolute monarch to one that interpreted the will the people. The trap, however, is in that interpretation: how do we find out what the general will wills. We might begin by asking two questions:\nWho are the people? How do we find out what said people will? The entire democratic procedure with its general elections, elected representatives, and universal suffrage are a means of answering these two questions. However, it is possible to arrive at alternative answers; one where you work backwards by deciding what ought to be willed and then deciding that those who share it are the people, and the rest become enemies of the people. It is a trap because it is surprisingly easy to begin to think this way; it is dangerous because here be terrors.\nJump to 2017 and current President of Brazil Lula was convicted on charges of money laundering and corruption and so was disqualified to run for the 2018 presidential election. Rather than decry the reduction in voter’s choice by removing a phenomenally popular politician, The Economist ran articles considering how he might influence politics from beyond the iron bars. The Times name-checking right-wing nationalists was also not coincidental. Both newspapers operate under the assumption that antagonising, even if imagined, politicians popular with right wing nationalists is a line not to be crossed, because they represent a more accurate portrayal of the people. Lula being a left-wing politician with a swell of working-class support was not given even the consideration that his supporters might feel aggrieved. Are The Economist or The Times proponents of right-wing nationalism themselves? I would say yes to The Times, but that would mark me as an outlier, and partisan politics does not explain why Jacobin would find themselves bedfellows with the two London newspapers. With Lula, Jacobin considered also the threats of the Brazilian army beyond the reaction of left-wing voters. What the Le Pen affair teaches us is that for these English-speaking publications, the general will is particularly concerned with what the right-wing populace might believe. Democracy be damned.\nPostscript:\nMy theory on the double standard with right-wing nationalist is one explanation for the tone taken by these Anglo-American publications. Another is elites vacating any responsibility in the face of ‘whatever the people want’, best explored by London based French journalist Marie Le Conte → https://youngvulgarian.substack.com/p/why-the-elites-love-and-fear-the The English newspapers in particular act as if embezzlement is too great a standard to be made ineligible to stand for election. The UK does in fact have many a qualification, including bankruptcy, being sentenced for more than three months, and a range of ‘illegal practices’ under the Representation of the People Act 1983. Is this because the French Presidency is not the British Member of Parliament? Does make the tone that ineligibility is unique to Ms Le Pen stranger.

Their first lesson is getting you to forget everything you have learnt before. Upon beginning one of my first physics classes, my teacher wrote the famous Socratic paradox on the board: “I know that I know nothing.”\nFar be it from me to draw out general conclusions from a half-remembered memory, but something has stayed with me. For years, I assumed the paradox was an attempt to humble those of us who felt we had reached the summit of knowledge, becoming comfortable and proud at how far we’d climbed. Now, with the passing of time, I see that it was precisely because what we knew wasn’t even true. The knowledge we had gained from a more basic account of the sciences would be next to useless as we were given a further peek behind the universe’s curtains. Telling us this at the onset was important, as my teacher could not rely on us discovering that ourselves as we learned new arguments for new facts; many of us, fresh from a blissful summer, had forgotten most of the facts we claimed to know. For example, I didn’t remember why Newton’s laws of motion worked the way they did, only that I know them, so I could not appreciate why quantum mechanics showed them to be less than accurate when the maths was put in front of us.\nScience teachers, faced with students ready to say they knew science without merit, realised the only way to teach us what we knew wasn’t true was to let us know we knew nothing. That our claims to knowledge were irrelevant to what our teachers aimed to teach; they could not rely on knocking away a foundation that we had forgotten existed, for our claim to knowledge was not based on truth. Battling untruthful claims to knowledge is a cause championed, in their own way, by disparate groups, including university professors, parents, and the late 2010’s campaigners in the war on Fake News.\nWith the electoral successes of Brexit and Donald Trump in the Anglophone world, the near miss of a Le Pen presidency in France, and Modi and Duterte making right-wing nationalism cool in the Global South, it really did appear that a kind of creeping authoritarianism was on the rise, fuelled by a care relationship to truth and accelerating upon the information superhighway. For a kind of liberal it really felt like there was a war to be fought on disinformation. On its 28th anniversary, the inventor of the World Wide Web declared fake news as a worrying trend preventing the internet from truly serving all of humanity. Since those ominous words by Timothy Bernard-Lee in 2017, conspiracy theories are back, from COVID denial to some questioning why trees remain after forest fires. With tools to mimic audio and video improved to such a state that you can watch Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and Barack Obama play Wii Sports, you’d think fake news and disinformation would once again fill the liberal world with more worry and more concern. Apart from the few AI researchers worried about misinformation[^1], we seem to have moved on. Fake News is yesterday’s problem, not solved, but far enough in the rearview mirror to prevent the same kind of anxiety it did almost a decade ago. These dire conditions appear to have inspired a kind of tolerated living. We did not choose this post-truth world; we just live in it.\nSome might see this post-truth world as inevitable. Drugs, Terror, Poverty, how often has a war against a noun succeeded? The War on Fake News can take its place on that list. But is this really a natural consequence of entering a post-truth world? Or is this rather a failure of how we think about truth and knowledge–seeing the latter only as a component of the first? In other words, are we post-truth or beyond it?\nTruth and Knowledge are related terms, especially in the war on Fake News, the former from which we added post- as a description was seen as both what was missing in the information we shared and therefore the solution. Knowledge, on the other hand, was the problem. The illusion of knowledge, that we believe we know more than we do or what we know isn’t actually true, is common to the world of conspiracy theories and falling for disinformation. Put simply, you could diagnose Fake News as knowledge without truth, leaving only belief and—for some—a rabid zeal to justify.\nIn the liberal mind, the real reason for the spread of knowledge without truth was the crumbling of trusted institutions. If you got what you know from sources less than your Facebook newsfeed, a salacious tabloid, or your secondary school science teacher, it will be without truth. Gone were the days of the state, university, and mainstream media being held up as paragons of truth in society. If the problem was knowledge without truth, then what was needed was impartial, objective, and trustworthy gatekeepers, designating facts and information as true or false. We see this with fact-checkers, deference to knowledgeable authority figures, and community notes on the website formerly called Twitter (maybe replace with critical thinking). Truth was forced and was soundly rejected, a politician can stand up, lie, and stare-down the fact checkers ‘til they enjoy a bountiful re-election. The prevailing diagnosis that underpinned the war on Fake News was, in retrospect, far too convenient for something as heady and abstract as truth.\nWe need to consider a world beyond it.\nThis reveals that many are not making knowledge claims at all but simply engaging in discourse. It’s how we communicate\nLet’s ignore truth for now and ask the question: When we say we know something, what do we actually mean? I want to answer this with an example. In school, I learned that William the Conqueror won the Battle of Hastings in 1066. I’d wager a great many British kids learned that fact, but let’s ask some questions:\n1 From where did I learn this? I could answer school, but pressed to be more precise, I’d come up short. Perhaps I read it outside school, heard it in a television show, or was told by someone I have now forgotten; 2 Do I believe the fact? Now that I’ve put myself on the spot, probably but it’s not something I’d stake a lot on. It is not a fact I have questioned but minor acquiescence is not the same as belief. 3 Finally, I promise this is the last question I’ll ask myself; can I justify my holding on to this fact? In other words, how do I know I haven’t arrived at this conclusion (if true) by luck? Perhaps I guess the year, misremembered an incorrect fact, or thought Hastings was actually somewhere else.\nTo some, asking these questions is how we check that what we know is true. For the common view is that knowledge is a composite of other factors that, should one be missing, out goes your claim. Considering knowledge as the resulting sum of a justified true belief, has consequences for how we deal with untrue information. I think it’s why you might believe that proving something isn’t true/or that a person doesn’t really believe what they’re claiming to know/or that they cannot justify how they came to that conclusion is the best way to fight fake news. Yet, some of those factors could not be proven here and I will still claim to know William the Conqueror won the Battle of Hastings in 1066.\nSome of you are already thinking that all I must ask is whether the fact is true. If it is, there is no problem to be solved. If William the Conqueror was not called that or lost the Battle of Hastings or any other number of inaccuracies, that knowledge is invalid. So, let’s try another example.\nI have a friend whose sports team had been at the top of the league for much of the season. They had played well and were multiple points clear. The betting markets had priced them as by far the favourites to lift the trophy and do so for the first time in nearly two decades. I talk to him, and he says he knows they will win the league. Using the first series of questions, we would say that he cannot say he knows they will win the league and, under the second test the league isn’t mathematically over so once again we ought to push back against this. I go to him and let him know that his information is invalid, and he laughs in my face.\nWhat is clear from these two examples is that when we say we know something, we might be doing something other than making a claim to knowledge. We’re not attempting to transmit truth at all. So when we try and treat it as such, we find ourselves in clashes of understanding. Framing and separating knowledge and knowing like this overturns conventional understanding of epistemology. Working along similar lines is philosopher Allan Hazlett who argues that philosophers group knowledge in the epistemological sense, that is, as something that has a series of stringent requirements and rigour, and knowing in the linguistic sense. When people say they know things, they do not mean they are factive, that is making a claim about the truthfulness of their statement. He proves this by substituting words. Going back to my friend and his trophy-less team, we could replace knows with a word that does not imply knowledge of facts: he thinks they will win the league; he believes they will win the league. Important is that there is nothing special about words like know that should make us believe the speaker is making a factive statement. The test Hazlitt proposed is rewording the phrase with what he called knowledge-wh phrases to the knowledge in question, for example: If I said my friend knows whether his team will win the league, or he knows who won the league. This can be contrasted from clearly non-factive telling-that phrases: my friend told us they would win the league vs my friend told us whether they would win the league. While the difference can be subtle, we can be clear that former is factive and the latter isn’t. This reveals many are not making knowledge claims at all but simply engaging in discourse. It’s how we communicate.\nTherefore, it is less that we are in a post-truth era but that we have appropriated claims that are merely discursive as actually factive. We were never in a ‘truth’ era to depart from. Perhaps this owes more a view more popular today that sees societal debate and discussion as oriented to finding truth[^2]. My friend in telling me he knows his team will win the league was less about the two of us deriving the universal truth about football or an attempt at divination but a fun conversation amongst friends about a common interest. Thus, him reacting poorly when I epistemologically checked him. So, too, are many attempts at preemptively correcting untrue statements. We need to remember to not approach every discourse as if they are a) making a knowledge claim and, b) making a knowledge claim at us.\nThis problem is made worse by how social media encourages and incentivises us to communicate. For one, we broadcast our thoughts rather than communicate them via conversations. So, when our posts reach others, it is without any context. Something that might be in response to something else is presented as if it stands on its own. If that is most of what you see, free standings broadcasts, social media platforms incentivise a language or norm within that group. For example, how many TikToks begin with a declaration that “we have to talk about” or “when are we going to have a conversation that”? Statements that treat the author as uttering the first statement in what is actually a long conversation. Another example is the site formerly known as Twitter adopting a strangely adversarial/combative tone, as if the author is preemptively arguing with phantoms. I don’t think these are the faults of the people communicating but how we align ourselves to norms. If everyone in a building takes off their hats, so will you. The consequence of the internet becoming an open public space is that people encounter those they would not interact with normally. Activists, journalists, students, and, worst of all, teenagers. As we increasingly move from feeds populated by choice and instead by algorithms, this clash of peoples will only increase. So, we meet platforms that encourage specific norms of communication, often using the language of factive statements, and push those to people that have no trust, context, or patience with the author. So, when a 15-year-old claims that they know that a respected director is terrible or otherwise makes a factual error, perhaps the 30-something-year-old overeducated professional should not strike down upon them with great vengeance and furious anger. Attempting to epistemologically check them will, like my attempt, fail because the two parties are having different conversations. I mean, how dumb were you at 15? In the old days of twitter (rip), there was always a main character of the day, someone whose tweets dominated the day’s discourse. The aim, accordingly, was never to be the main character. What was striking was how often that main character was someone whom most users would never interact with, had a small following, and often made claims that received by their group would be innocuous. I’m embarrassed by how many edgy teenagers were on the receiving end of a barrage of corrections. Treating public discourse as truth-finding empowers everyone online with a hammer and turns every statement into a nail.\nMaking this process worse are the systems that present nails in a row, ready to be smashed. When you come across something that animates you to respond, rather than leaving a reply or a comment, most people choose instead to react. They quote the post, duet, or overlay their recorded reaction in a video. Rather than containing their responses to the comments and replies of the original text the natural response is to create something new. This might seem like a normal choice, but it’s a result of many micro-incentives by the platform builders. For one, replies and comments are lost in an ocean of noise. From scams to off-topic segues, leaving a comment on any platform is to be in a place where eyes glance through at best. So you of course you broadcast, with your thoughts and comments and original context removed. What might have been an innocent comment or joke or half-thought is now shared to more than it should’ve.\nThe war on Fake News began overconfident with what we knew about the problem. Empowered, by the kind of blind optimism that can only exist in a technocratic society, believed we had solved most problems and the fault lay not in our systems and ways of communication but in us; human error rather than flawed design. The first part of solving a problem is acknowledging how little we know about it, so that we are not encumbered by bad habits and poor norms. The first thing we have to do is join in the joke, and like science teachers of years gone by, pull up a white board and write: all we know is that we know nothing.\n","date":"4 March 2025","permalink":"/posts/first-post/lies-1/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Distinguishing Knowing from Knowledge"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/truth/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Truth"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
